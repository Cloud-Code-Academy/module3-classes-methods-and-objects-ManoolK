# Developer Kickstart Module 3: Classes, Methods, and Objects

This repository is part of the Developer Kickstart module 3 curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. It's designed to help beginner Salesforce developers learn and practice the principles of Object-Oriented Programming in the Apex language, specifically focusing on classes, methods, and objects.

## Goals of the Practice
Through this practice repository, you'll gain foundational knowledge about:
- Understanding the role and structure of classes in Apex, including properties and methods.
- How to create and use objects in Apex.
- The principles of encapsulation and the importance of getter and setter methods.
- The interaction between objects, specifically object references and passing objects to methods.

This foundational knowledge will prepare you for more advanced topics in Salesforce development, such as inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism. The curriculum includes practical examples with classes such as Person and Book to solidify these concepts.

## Note
Certain test methods related to the Book and Person classes are currently commented out and will need to be uncommented and deployed once the relevant classes are set up.
